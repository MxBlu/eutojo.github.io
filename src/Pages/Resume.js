            Collaborated closely with Computer Engineering PhD students

            that best showcase their research results. One of my clients won 
            best paper at Embedded Systems Week in 2018!

            Assisted the Head Teacher in managing a class of 25 primary 
            school children and helping them build their own games using 
            Stencyl. I had to think on my feet and debug quickly to 
            ensure that students left the workshops with a sense of 
            accomplishment. I also had to simplify complex programming 
            ideas to young students such that they could grasp a basic 
            understanding of coding.

            Provided assistance to high schoolers struggling with mathematics in

            had to teach them the fundamentals and the basics of mental 
            maths, as well as encourage my client to become a more 
            independent learner. It was highly rewarding to see my
